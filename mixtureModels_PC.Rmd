# Faithful data

Fit a mixture of two normal distributions to the faithful data

 1. assuming different proportions, means and variances for the 2 distributions

 2. assuming same variances 
 
 3. assuming same means
 
 4. assuming same proportions

# Epilepsy data


 The data <ttt>seizures.csv</ttt> consists of  daily counts of epileptic seizures for 6 patients.
 
 1. Load and plot the data


 2. Select the id 12 and fit a Poisson distribution to the number of seizures for this patient.


  3. Implement and use a EM algorithm for fitting a mixture of 2 Poisson distributions to this data
  
  4. Compare the two models
  
  5. Do the same analysis with other id's
