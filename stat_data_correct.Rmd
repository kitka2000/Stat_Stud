## Outliers

The most common definition is that it is a value that lies far away from the main body of observations for a variable and could distort summaries of the distribution of values. In practice this translates to a value that is 1.5 times the IQR (interquartile range) more extreme than the quartiles of the distribution.
The most effective way to see an outlier is to use a boxplot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DescTools)
library(ggpubr)
tnf <- read.csv2("C:/Users/MagdaG/Desktop/talid.csv")
tnf_long <- tnf %>% 
 gather(vis0:vis4, key = "visit", value = "value") %>% 
 group_by(visit)

gr_tnf_vis2 <- tnf_long %>% 
 filter(!is.na(visit) & !is.na(value)) %>% 
 ggboxplot(x = "visit", y = "value",
 palette = "aaas", 
 title = "TNF Levels by Visit - Thalidomide Group",
 xlab = "Visit",
 ylab = "TNF level",
 ggtheme = theme_gray())
suppressMessages(gr_tnf_vis2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
